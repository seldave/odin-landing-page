        <h1>What do we do?</h1>
        We are dedicated to improving the health and well-being of children in need. 
        Our programs provide essential healthcare services, including regular medical 
        check-ups, vaccinations, and treatment for illnesses. We work to ensure that 
        every child has access to clean water, nutritious food, and proper sanitation, 
        all of which are critical to maintaining good health. Additionally, we offer 
        mental health support and counseling to help children cope with the emotional 
        challenges they face. Through our health initiatives, we aim to give every child 
        the opportunity to grow up healthy and strong.

    <h3>Some Testimonies</h3>
    <img src="./images/maria.jpg" alt="picture of of a little girl called maria">
    <span>Maria lived in a rural area where many children, including her, were unvaccinated. 
        A health campaign provided vaccines and taught families their importance. 
        After receiving the necessary shots, Maria's health improved, and preventable 
        diseases like measles and polio were no longer a concern in her village.</span>
    <img src="./images/liam.jpg" alt="picture of a little boy named liam">
    <span>Liam, a young boy affected by a natural disaster, struggled with trauma and 
        anxiety. A child mental health program offered counseling and emotional support. 
        Over time, Liam regained his confidence, started engaging in school again, and 
        his emotional well-being greatly improved.</span>
    <img src="./images/john.jpg" alt="picture of a little boy named john">
    <span>John's village struggled with waterborne diseases due to a lack of clean 
        drinking water. A health initiative installed water wells and educated the 
        community on hygiene. Afterward, John and other children saw improved health 
        and a drastic reduction in illnesses like diarrhea, allowing them to attend 
        school regularly.</span>
    <img src="./images/sarah.jpg" alt="picture of a little girl called sarah">
    <span>Sarah, a five-year-old from a remote village, was suffering from 
        severe malnutrition. With help from a child health program, she received 
        nutrient-rich meals and healthcare. Within months, Sarah gained weight and 
        returned to a healthy development path. Her mother also learned how to maintain 
        the family's nutrition.</span>

        I alone cannot change the world, but I can cast a stone across the waters to 
        create many ripples. We can do no great things, only small things with great 
        love. Each one of them is Jesus in disguise. It is not enough for me to be 
        compassionate. I must act. And to act is to care.</br>
